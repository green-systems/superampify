This is a function that generates a handshake that works with
Ampache, and OwnCloud.

This handshake serves as a way to keep the session going
(instead of passing the user and the password around on each
call)

Notice how it takes the user and the password, in plaintext.

So, it can only be generated during log-in time (the only time
the user sends the password in clear text to the server)

This handshake gets read later in subtunes.

So, the idea here is:
	- Generate this handshake on log-in time in runners-id.
	- Save it on the session, whatever the way runners-id handles sessions.
	- Read it on subtunes, when it's opened.

Basically, this code is just a showcase that this works.
